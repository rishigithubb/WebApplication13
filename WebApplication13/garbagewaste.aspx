                <h4>Learn to Reduce</h4>
                <p>Reducing is simply creating less waste. It’s the best method for keeping the environment </p>
                   <!-- clean, so it’s the first of the 3 Rs. By reducing, you stop the problem at the source. Making less waste to begin with means there’s less waste to clean up. Here are some easy ways you can reduce the amount of waste you make:
                   Pack your lunch in a lunchbox. Paper and plastic bags create a huge amount of waste — and plastic bags take hundreds of years to decompose.  -->

                <h4>Learn to Reuse</h4>
                <p>Reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw away and finding a new use for them.</p> 
                <!-- There are all sorts of ways you can reuse items to help reduce your trash footprint:
                   Clean out your closet. Maybe your size has changed. Maybe your tastes have changed. Instead of throwing away clothes you don’t want anymore, give them to someone who will want them.</p> -->

                <h4>Learn to Recycle</h4>
                <p>Recycling is the last — and most commonly used — of the 3 Rs. Recycling is changing discarded materials into new products</p>
                     <!-- in order to avoid using more virgin resources.
                    Corrugated cardboard, milk jug style containers, newspaper and inserts, and tin and aluminum cans can all go in your Rogue Disposal & Recycling red-lid cart to be recycled.</p> -->
